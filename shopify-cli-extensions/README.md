# Shopify CLI Extensions

`shopify-extensions` is an add-on to the Shopify CLI, which is installed automatically when installing the CLI. It is not meant to be invoked directly. Instead, invocation of `shopify-extensions` occurs through `shopify extension`. Today, `shopify-extensions`' main purpose is to power the experience of `shopify extension serve`, `shopify extension build` and augment `shopify extension create`.

The information below is mainly targeting contributors rather than users. If you want to learn more about how to build extensions and how to use the Shopify CLI in general, please consult the [official documentation](https://shopify.dev/apps/tools/cli).

## Setup

Install Go:

```sh
brew install go
```

## Test

To run the tests, simply execute the following shell command:

```sh
make test
```

### Bootstrap extensions

To bootstrap extensions and install of node dependencies, run:

```sh
make run bootstrap
```

This will create extensions in the `tmp` folder and install the node dependencies.

### Serve

After [boostrapping an extension](#bootstrap-an-extension), you can run the server by execute the following shell command:

```sh
make run serve < testdata/shopifile.yml
```

Subsequently, you should be able to retrieve sample assets as follows:

```sh
curl http://localhost:8000/extensions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/assets/index.js
```
## Publish

Choose version

```sh
yarn version-bump
```

Then push up bump, plus changes.

```sh
git push --follow-tags
```

## DevConsole development

Run the DevConsole app and Dev Server simultaneously when developing for the DevConsole.

```sh
make serve-dev
```

## Create

To create a new extension project, simply execute the following shell command:

```sh
make run serve < testdata/shopifile.yml
```

This will create a new extension inside the `tmp/checkout_ui_extension` folder. You can update `testdata/shopifile.yml` if you want to test different options.

The YAML file is in the format of

```yml
extensions:
  - uuid: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
    type: TYPE
    development:
      root_dir: 'api/testdata'
