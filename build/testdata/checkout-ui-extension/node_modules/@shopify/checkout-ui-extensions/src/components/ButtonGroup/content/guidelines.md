## Best practices

- Only use buttons that follow the best practices outlined in the [Button](https://github.com/Shopify/ui-extensions/tree/main/packages/checkout-ui-extensions/src/components/Button) component
- Group together calls to action that have a relationship
- Too many calls to action can cause customers to be unsure of what to do next
- Be thoughtful about how multiple buttons will look and work on small screens
