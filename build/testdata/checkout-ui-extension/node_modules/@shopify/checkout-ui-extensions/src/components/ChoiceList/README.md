# ChoiceList

Use choice lists to present a list of choices where buyers can make
a single selection or multiple selections.

## Props
optional = ?

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name | <code>string</code> | An identifier for the field that is unique within the nearest containing `&lt;Form /&gt;` component.  |
| value | <code>T</code> | A string or array of strings indicating the ids of selected choices. When a string is provided, choices render as radios. When a string array is provided, choices render as checkboxes.  |
| onChange | <code>(value: T) => void</code> | A callback that is run whenever the choice list is changed. This callback is called with a string or array of strings indicating the ids of choices that should now be selected. This component is [controlled](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components), so you **must** store this value in state and reflect it back in the `value` prop.  |
