  /**
   * Callback when the buyer has **finished editing** a stepper field. Unlike `onChange`
   * callbacks you may be familiar with from Polaris or other React component libraries,
   * this callback is **not** run on every change to the input. Stepper fields are
   * “partially controlled” components, which means that while the buyer edits the
   * field, its state is controlled by the component. Once the buyer has signalled that
   * they have finished editing the field (typically, by blurring the field), `onChange`
   * is called if the input actually changed from the most recent `value` property. At
   * that point, you are expected to store this “committed value” in state, and reflect
   * it in the stepper field’s `value` property.
   *
   * A buyer can change the stepper field value with the increment/decrement buttons
   * A long press and hold will allow a buyer to rapidly increase/decrease the value.
   * The `onChange` callback is only run when the button is released.
   *
   * This state management model is important given how extension UIs are rendered.
   * UI extension components run on a separate thread from the checkout UI, so they can’t
   * respond to input synchronously. A pattern popularized by
   * [controlled React components](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components)
   * is to have the component be the source of truth for the input `value`, and update
   * the `value` on every user input. The delay in responding to events from a UI
   * extension is only a few milliseconds, but attempting to strictly store state with
   * this delay can cause issues if a user types quickly, or if the buyer is using a
   * lower-powered device. Having the checkout UI thread take ownership for “in progress”
   * input, and only synchronizing when the user is finished with a field, avoids this risk.
   *
   * This callback is called with the current value of the field. If the value of a field
   * is the same as the current `value` prop provided to the field, the `onChange` callback
   * will not be run.
