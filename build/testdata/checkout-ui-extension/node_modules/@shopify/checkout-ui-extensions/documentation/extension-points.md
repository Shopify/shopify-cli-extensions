# Extension points

A UI Extension will register for one or more extension points using [`shopify.extend()`](./globals.md). An extension point in a UI extension is a plain JavaScript function. This function receives some API for interacting with the application, and is expected to return a value in a specific shape. The input arguments and the output type are different for each extension point.

The current extension points are available for Checkout:

- `Checkout::Feature::Render`, used to build extensions that the merchant can position anywhere in their checkout.
