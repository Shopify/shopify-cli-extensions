 *  View is a generic container component. Its contents will always be their

 * `BlockStack`, `InlineStack`) that would otherwise stretch their children to fit.
 *
 * Note: View’s box model related properties like `padding`, `border`, `borderRadius`, and `borderColor` are implemented as
 * [CSS Logical Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Logical_Properties/Basic_concepts).
