### Responsive

Responsive is a [Mapped Type](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/mapped-types.html). It allows you to set different values at different breakpoints by providing an object where the keys are Breakpoints: <code>"base" &#124; "small" &#124; "medium" &#124; "large"</code>

For example, if a property accepts `number | Responsive`, it would accept a number or an object where the keys are Breakpoints and the values are numbers:

{% highlight js %}{% raw %}
{
  'base': 1,
  'small': 0.5,
  'large': 2
}
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
