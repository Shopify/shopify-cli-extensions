     * Callback when the buyer has **finished editing** a field. Unlike `onChange`
     * callbacks you may be familiar with from Polaris or other React component libraries,
     * this callback is **not** run on every change to the input. Text fields are
     * “partially controlled” components, which means that while the buyer edits the
     * field, its state is controlled by the component. Once the buyer has signalled that
     * they have finished editing the field (typically, by blurring the field), `onChange`
     * is called if the input actually changed from the most recent `value` property. At
     * that point, you are expected to store this “committed value” in state, and reflect
     * it in the text field’s `value` property.
     *
     * This state management model is important given how UI Extensions are rendered. UI Extension components
     * run on a separate thread from the UI, so they can’t respond to input synchronously.
     * A pattern popularized by [controlled React components](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components)
     * is to have the component be the source of truth for the input `value`, and update
     * the `value` on every user input. The delay in responding to events from a UI
     * extension is only a few milliseconds, but attempting to strictly store state with
     * this delay can cause issues if a user types quickly, or if the buyer is using a
     * lower-powered device. Having the UI thread take ownership for “in progress” input,
     * and only synchronizing when the user is finished with a field, avoids this risk.
     *
     * It can still sometimes be useful to be notified when the user makes any input in
     * the field. If you need this capability, you can use the `onInput` prop. However,
     * never use that property to create tightly controlled state for the `value`.
     *
     * This callback is called with the current value of the field. If the value of a field
     * is the same as the current `value` prop provided to the field, the `onChange` callback
     * will not be run.
