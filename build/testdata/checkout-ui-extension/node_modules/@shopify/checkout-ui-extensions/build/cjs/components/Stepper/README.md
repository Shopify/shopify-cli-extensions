# Stepper

A Stepper is used as a quick way for buyers to change a pre-defined number.

## Props
optional = ?

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| accessibilityDescription? | <code>string</code> | A detailed description for screen readers.  |
| disabled? | <code>boolean</code> | Whether the stepper field can be modified.  |
| error? | <code>string</code> | An error label to present with the stepper field.  |
| id? | <code>string</code> | A unique identifier for the stepper. When no `id` is provided, a globally unique value will be used instead.  |
| label | <code>string</code> | Content to use as the stepper label. This value is also used as the placeholder when the stepper is empty.  |
| max? | <code>number</code> | The highest decimal or integer to be accepted for the stepper field. When used with `step` the value will round down to the max number. Note: a buyer will still be able to use the keyboard to input a number lower than the min. It is up to the developer to add appropriate validation.  |
| min? | <code>number</code> | The lowest decimal or integer to be accepted for the stepper field. When used with `step` the value will round up to the min number. Note: a buyer will still be able to use the keyboard to input a number lower than the min. It is up to the developer to add appropriate validation. Default value: <code>0</code> |
| name? | <code>string</code> | An identifier for the stepper that is unique within the nearest containing `&lt;Form /&gt;` component.  |
| onBlur? | <code>() => void</code> | Callback when focus is removed.  |
| onChange? | <code>(value: string) => void</code> | Callback when the buyer has **finished editing** a stepper field. Unlike `onChange` callbacks you may be familiar with from Polaris or other React component libraries, this callback is **not** run on every change to the input. Stepper fields are “partially controlled” components, which means that while the buyer edits the field, its state is controlled by the component. Once the buyer has signalled that they have finished editing the field (typically, by blurring the field), `onChange` is called if the input actually changed from the most recent `value` property. At that point, you are expected to store this “committed value” in state, and reflect it in the stepper field’s `value` property.<br /><br />A buyer can change the stepper field value with the increment/decrement buttons A long press and hold will allow a buyer to rapidly increase/decrease the value. The `onChange` callback is only run when the button is released.<br /><br />This state management model is important given how extension UIs are rendered. UI extension components run on a separate thread from the checkout UI, so they can’t respond to input synchronously. A pattern popularized by [controlled React components](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components) is to have the component be the source of truth for the input `value`, and update the `value` on every user input. The delay in responding to events from a UI extension is only a few milliseconds, but attempting to strictly store state with this delay can cause issues if a user types quickly, or if the buyer is using a lower-powered device. Having the checkout UI thread take ownership for “in progress” input, and only synchronizing when the user is finished with a field, avoids this risk.<br /><br />This callback is called with the current value of the field. If the value of a field is the same as the current `value` prop provided to the field, the `onChange` callback will not be run.  |
| onFocus? | <code>() => void</code> | Callback when input is focused.  |
| readonly? | <code>boolean</code> | Whether the stepper field is read-only.  |
| required? | <code>boolean</code> | Whether the stepper field needs a value. This requirement adds semantic value to the field, but it will not cause an error to appear automatically. If you want to present an error when this field is empty, you can do so with the `error` prop.  |
| step? | <code>number</code> | The amount the value can increase or decrease by. This can be an integer or decimal. If a `max` or `min` is specified with `step` when increasing/decreasing the value via the stepper buttons the final value will always round to the `max` or `min` rather than the closest valid amount. Default value: <code>1</code> |
| value? | <code>number</code> | Current value for the stepper. If omitted, the field will be empty. You should update this value in response to the `onChange` callback on a stepper field.  |
