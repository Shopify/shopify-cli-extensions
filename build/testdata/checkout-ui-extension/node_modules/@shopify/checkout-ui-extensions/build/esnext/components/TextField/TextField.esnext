 * A text field is an input field that merchants can type into.

 * Its children will be rendered as actions inside at the end of the text field.
 *
 * Focused `input` and `select` children elements will toggle text field's focus state
 * so place there only elements tighly coupled with the text field.
 * For the other cases consider the `Connected` component.
 *
 * Its children are commonly used to display an icon that opens a `Tooltip` that provides more
 * information about the field.
